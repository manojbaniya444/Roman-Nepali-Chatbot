A more sophisticated version of the frame based architecture
Has dialogue acts more ML better generation

Has dialogue state tracker: maintains the current state of the dialogue.
(users most recent dialogue act, set of slot filler constraints from user)

Has dialogue policy: what the system should do or say next.

Has NLG: to generate appropriate answer, more natural less template based.

Use slot filling as sequence labeling BIO tagging as sequence label machine learning

use BERT like model or BiLSTM

# Dialogue policy
- What to say
given dialogue state which state to take
argmax of action over argmax of all previous action

# Dialogue Generation
- How to say it
