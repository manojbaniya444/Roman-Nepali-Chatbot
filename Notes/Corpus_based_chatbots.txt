## Response by Retrieval
use information retrieval to grab a response that is appropriate to the context/
## Response by generation
Use a language model or Encoder-Decoder to generate the response given the dialogue context

Think of response production as an ecoder-decoder task, 
generate each token rt of the response by conditioning on the encoding of the entire query q and the response so frame
rt = argmax w belongs to V P(w | q, r1,...rt-1)
rt = response token
w = word belong to vocab
V = vocab
r1...rt-1 = all word token generated

Alternative to Encoder Decoder is Fine Tuning a Large Language Model on conversation dataset fine tune GPT, Gemma2 2b

Basic Encoder Decoder Model tends to get repetitive and boring.
