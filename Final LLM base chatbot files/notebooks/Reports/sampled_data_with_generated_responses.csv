The stars twinkle in the night sky, Like diamonds in the darkness they fly, They light up the world with their radiant glow, And make us wonder where they go. Their beauty and wonder we cannot deny, They are a reminder of the night sky’s beauty, They are a symbol of hope and dreams, And they remind us that we are not alone. Their light shines on, and their story remains, As we watch them in the heavens with delight.

The process of photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. During photosynthesis, the plant absorbs carbon dioxide from the air through its leaves and water through its roots. The plant then uses the energy from sunlight to convert the carbon dioxide and water into glucose, which is a sugar that the plant uses for energy. The plant also produces oxygen as a byproduct of this process. The plant then uses the glucose and oxygen to produce energy and grow.

<end_of_turn>model
Cloning is the process of creating an exact copy of something, often used in reference to making identical copies of cells, tissues, or even organisms. In biology, cloning refers to the process of creating a genetically identical copy of a cell, tissue, or organism. This can be done by taking a cell from an organism and growing it in a laboratory to create a new individual that is genetically identical to the original. Cloning can also be used in medicine, for example to create tissues or organs for transplantation."

In 4D printing, materials change their shape over time due to changes in temperature, light, or other external stimuli. It’s a type of additive manufacturing that combines the traditional 3D printing with an extra dimension of time.
